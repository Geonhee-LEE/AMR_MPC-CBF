# AMR_MPC-CBF

Safety-critical optimal control is one of the most important problems in robotics. In this work, we unify Nonlinear Model Predictive Control with Control Barrier Functions that generate safety constraints for obstacle avoidance.

We are going to study the case of the unicycle by proposing different scenarios (e.g., fixed or moving obstacles, different paths, single or multiple cars).

The project is developed by:
  - Rossella Bonuomo
  - Marco Pennese
  - Veronica Vulcano

The simulations have been implemented in Python using the acados solver for Nonlinear MPC. For more details, check the acados documentation [here](https://docs.acados.org).
